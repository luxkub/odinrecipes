    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The movie "Home Alone" served as inspiration to this macaroni and cheese. Although it says it's meant for one, it
        will serve two if you're feeling generous!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup elbow macaroni </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>¾ cup fat-free half-and-half </li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dry mustard powder </li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper </li>
        <li>1 pinch ground turmeric </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring
            occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in flour until mixture is smooth. Slowly add
            half-and-half, whisking as it is poured in. Stir until sauce thickens slightly, about 3 minutes. Add Cheddar
            cheese, salt, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, pepper, and turmeric; whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Drain macaroni and add to the cheese sauce. Stir until evenly coated.</li>
    </ol>
